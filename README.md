# BlenderShapeKey
automatic shapekey baking into blender animation

This script allows the user to bake all the shape keys into animation keys with the press of a button,
without adding/removing animation modifier for each shapekey layer.

Certain bugs with the endkey are know but due to limitation of global parameters currently not fixable.

V1.0 - V1.1 works with Blender 2.9
V1.2 works with Blender 3.0 and higher
